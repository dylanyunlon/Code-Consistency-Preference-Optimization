["1 hour and 10 minutes, or 70 minutes.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. We know that Millennium runs for 2 hours, or 120 minutes.\n2. Alpha Epsilon is 30 minutes shorter than Millennium, so its running time is 120 - 30 = 90 minutes.\n3. Beast of War: Armoured Command runs 10 minutes longer than Alpha Epsilon, so its running time is 90 + 10 = 100 minutes.\n4. However, we're asked for the answer in minutes, so we need to convert hours and minutes to minutes. To do this, we multiply the number of hours by 60 and add the number of minutes: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 10 minutes = 70 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command is 70 minutes.", " To find the other x-intercept, we need to find the solution of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

We know that there are 10 bags, and each bag contains 30 oranges, so there are a total of 10 * 30 = 300 oranges.\n2. We also know that there are 50 oranges that are rotten and cannot be sold.\n3. However, we have reserved 30 oranges for making orange juice, which will not be sold either.\n4. So, the number of oranges available to be sold is the total number of oranges minus the rotten oranges and the oranges reserved for juice: 300 - 50 - 30 = 220.\n5. But we made an error in our initial calculation of the total number of oranges. We assumed that each bag contained 30 good oranges, but in fact, each bag contains 30 oranges in total, so there are 270 good oranges (30 oranges per bag * 10 bags).\n6. Therefore, the correct number of oranges available to be sold is: 270 - 50 = 220 + 30 = 250. But we had already subtracted 30 oranges for juice, so we need to add them back: 250 + 30 = 280.\n7. However, we made an error in our calculation of the number of oranges reserved for juice. We assumed that there were 30 oranges reserved for juice, but we don't know how many oranges were rotten before they were reserved for juice. So, we cannot determine the exact number of oranges available to be sold based on the given information.\n8. But if we assume that all the oranges were good initially, and 30 were reserved for juice, then we can calculate the number of oranges available to be sold if no oranges were rotten: 270 - 30 = 240.\n9. Since we know that 50 oranges were rotten, then the number of oranges available to be sold is 240 - 50 = 190.\n10. However, we made an error in our initial calculation of the total number of oranges. We assumed that each bag contained 30 oranges in total, but if 30 oranges were reserved for juice, then each bag contains only 27 good oranges. So, the correct calculation is: 10 * 27 = 270 good oranges.\n11. Therefore, the number of oranges available to be sold is: 270 - 50 = 220. But we had already subtracted 30 oranges for juice, so we need to add them back: 220 + 30 = 250.\n12. However, we made an error in our calculation of the number of oranges reserved for juice. We assumed that there were 30 oranges reserved for juice, but we don't know how many oranges were rotten before they were reserved for juice. So, we cannot determine the exact number of oranges available to be sold based on the given information.\n13. But if we assume that no oranges were rotten before they were reserved for juice, then the number of oranges available to be sold is: 270 - 30 = 240.\n14. Therefore, if no oranges were rotten before they were reserved for juice, then 170 oranges will be available to be sold (240 - 70, where 70 is the number of oranges reserved for juice).\n15. However, we cannot determine the exact number of oranges available to be sold based on the given information, as we don't know how many oranges were rotten before they were reserved for juice.

We can set up the following equation:\n\na * 10 + b = year\n\nWe want the sum of the digits to be 12, so:\n\na + b = 12\n\nWe know that a cannot be zero, so let's start testing values for a that are greater than zero:\n\nIf a = 1: b = 11, but this doesn't give us a valid year (11 is not a valid digit for the units place).\n\nIf a = 2: b = 10, which gives us the year 2010, but that's not the answer we're looking for since we want the first year after 2004.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that a = 3 and b = 9 give us the year 3009, which is not a valid year either.\n\nThe next pair of digits that satisfy the condition a + b = 12 are 4 and 8. Therefore, the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12 is 2014.", "1. During the first hour, Carol fills the pool with 8 gallons of water.\n2. During the second and third hours, she fills it with 10 gallons of water per hour, so she fills 10 gallons * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 gallons.\n3. In total, after three hours, the pool contains 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 gallons.\n4. During the fourth hour, the pool fills with x gallons of water.\n5. In five hours, the pool should contain 28 + x gallons of water.\n6. However, during the fifth hour, the pool loses 8 gallons due to the leak.\n7. So, the actual amount of water in the pool after five hours is 28 + x - 8 = <<28+x-8=20x-8>>20x - 8 gallons.\n8. We know that the final amount of water is 34 gallons, so we can set up an equation: 20x - 8 = 34.\n9.

To find her current weight, subtract the weight she lost from her original weight:\n\nPatty's current weight = Patty's original weight - weight lost\nPatty's current weight = 450 pounds - 235 pounds\nPatty's current weight = 215 pounds\n\nSo, Patty now weighs 215 pounds, and Robbie weighs 100 pounds. To find the difference in weight between Patty and Robbie, subtract Robbie's weight from Patty's weight:\n\nDifference in weight = Patty's weight - Robbie's weight\nDifference in weight = 215 pounds - 100 pounds\nDifference in weight = 115 pounds\n\nTherefore, Patty currently weighs 115 pounds more than Robbie.", "1.

The positive square root of 729 is 27 (since 27 * 27 = 729).\n2. The negative square root of 729 is -27 (since (-27) * (-27) = 729).\n\nSo, the possible values of $x$ are $x = \\pm 27$. However, since $x$ is given to be positive, we typically only consider the positive value. But in this case, we were asked to find both possible values. Therefore, the value of $x$ is 11 or -11.\n\nThis might be a bit confusing because 11 * 11 = 121, which is not equal to 729. But remember, we're not looking for a value of $x$ such that $x \\times x = 121$; we're looking for a value of $x$ such that $x^2 = 729$.

We can find the cost of the chicken by subtracting the cost of the beef and the oil from the total amount paid:\n\nTotal cost = Chicken cost + Beef cost + Oil cost\n\nWe know the cost of the chicken and the oil, but we don't have enough information to find the exact cost of the beef since we only know its weight (3 pounds). However, we do know that the cost of the chicken is less than $16, so let's try to find a reasonable estimate for the cost of the beef and oil based on the information given.\n\nLet's assume that the cost of the oil is negligible compared to the cost of the chicken and beef. Let's also assume that the cost of the beef is around $12 per pound, which is a common price range for ground beef.\n\nWith these assumptions, we can calculate the cost of the beef:\n\nBeef cost = 3 pounds * $12/pound = $36\n\nNow we can find the cost of the chicken:\n\nTotal cost = Chicken cost + Beef cost + Oil cost\n$16 = Chicken cost + $36 + Oil cost\n\nSince we assume that the oil cost is negligible, we can ignore it for now:\n\n$16 = Chicken cost + $36\nChicken cost = $10\n\nSince there are three people splitting the cost of the chicken evenly, each person should pay:\n\nCost per person = Chicken cost / Number of people\nCost per person = $10 / 3 = $3.33 (approximately)\n\nSo, each of Mary and her two friends should pay approximately $3.33 for the chicken.", "To find an equation relating the square of the $W^{+}$ boson mass and the neutrino and anti-muon momentum components, we cannot directly use the given information since it only provides the total energy and momentum of the $W^{+}$ boson, neutrino, and anti-muon in their respective frames.

Let's denote the distance each team member runs as d (in kilometers). We know that there are x team members, and the total distance of the race is 18 units.\n\n2. The sum of the distances of all team members should equal the total race distance:\nd * x = 18\n\n3. We also know that Ralph runs twice as much as any team member. Let's call the distance of any team member \"a\". Ralph runs 2 * a.\n\n4. We can set up an equation representing the relationship between Ralph's distance and the team members' distances:\na + a + ... + a + (2 * a) = 18\n\n5. We have x team members, so we have x instances of the variable \"a\" in the sum.\n\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get:\nx * a + 2 * a = 18\n\n7. Combining the terms with \"a\", we get:\n(x + 2) * a = 18\n\n8. Dividing both sides by (x + 2), we get:\na = 18 / (x + 2)\n\n9. Since \"a\" represents the distance each team member runs, we now know that each team member runs 18 / (x + 2) kilometers.\n\n10. To find Ralph's distance, we use the relationship we established earlier: Ralph runs 2 * a.\n\n11.

Natalie picked fewer strawberries than both Betty and Matthew, so let's call the number of strawberries Natalie picked \"n\". We know that Matthew picked twice as many as Natalie, so Natalie picked <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.\n4. Together, they had 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + n (Natalie) = <<16+36+n=68>>68 strawberries.\n5. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries.\n6. They made 40 dollars from selling the jars. Since there are 3 strawberries in a jar (7 strawberries per jar divided by 2 jars per pound, assuming 1 pound = 16 ounces and 16 ounces = 1 pound), they made 40 dollars from selling 40 jars.\n7. Therefore, the price per jar is 40 dollars divided by 40 jars = $1 per jar.\n8. Since one jar uses 7 strawberries, the price per strawberry is $1 per jar divided by 7 strawberries per jar = $0.143 per strawberry.\n\nNow we have to find out how many strawberries they picked in total and the price per strawberry, but we don't have enough information to find the exact value of \"x\". We only know that they made $40 from selling the jars and that one jar contains 7 strawberries.

This means that when there are no cars parked, the number of cars that can fit on one level is:\n\nLevel capacity without cars = Level capacity with cars - x\nLevel capacity without cars = 62 cars - x\n\nSince there are 5 levels in the parking lot, we can calculate the total number of cars that can be parked by summing up the number of cars that can be parked on each level:\n\nTotal cars = Number of cars on Level 1 + Number of cars on Level 2 + ... + Number of cars on Level 5\n\nLet's calculate the number of cars that can be parked on each level:\n\nLevel 1: 62 - x cars\nLevel 2: 62 - x cars\nLevel 3: 62 - x cars\nLevel 4: 62 - x cars\nLevel 5: 62 - x cars\n\nTotal cars = (62 - x) + (62 - x) + (62 - x) + (62 - x) + (62 - x)\nTotal cars = 5 * (62 - x)\n\nHowever, we cannot have a negative number of cars, so we need to ensure that the number of cars we calculate does not result in fewer cars than the initial capacity of the parking lot (425 cars).

Since we know that this includes a one-time 10% interest fee, we can find the amount of the loan by subtracting the interest from the total amount:\n\nLoan amount = T - 0.1 * T = 0.9 * T = 13,256\n\nTherefore, the value of x is:\n\nx = T / 12 = 13,256 / 12 = 1,104.67 (approximately)\n\nSo Aaron will pay $1,104.67 per month for the guitar.", "13.6 stamps per day on average\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. Margaret collected 8 stamps on the first day.\n2. The second day she collected 8 stamps more than the first day, so she collected 16 stamps.\n3. The third day she collected 8 stamps more than the second day, so she collected 24 stamps.\n4. The fourth day she collected 8 stamps more than the third day, so she collected 32 stamps.\n5. The fifth day she collected 8 stamps more than the fourth day, so she collected 40 stamps.\n6. To find the average number of stamps collected per day, we add up the number of stamps collected during the 5 days and divide by 5: (8 + 16 + 24 + 32 + 40) / 5 = 136 / 5 = 13.6 stamps per day on average.", "Let's calculate the total hours David will spend on classes each week, and then add the hours he'll spend on homework:\n\nClasses:\n2 three-hour classes * 3 hours/class = 6 hours\n1 four-hour class * 4 hours/class = 4 hours\nTotal hours per week for classes = 6 + 4 = 10 hours\n\nHomework:\n4 hours/week\n\nSo, the total hours David will spend on this course each week is:\n\nTotal hours per week = Class hours + Homework hours\nTotal hours per week = 10 hours + 4 hours\nTotal hours per week = 14 hours\n\nSince the course lasts for 24 weeks, the total hours David will spend on this course are:\n\nTotal hours for the course = Total hours per week * Number of weeks\nTotal hours for the course = 14 hours/week * 24 weeks\nTotal hours for the course = 336 hours.", "To determine the domain and range of $g(x)$, we first need to find the domain of $f(x)$.

Since $f$ has domain $[0,2]$, this means that $x \\in [0,1]$ for $g(x)$ to be defined. Therefore, the domain of $g(x)$ is $[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the range of $g(x)$, we need to find the range of $f(x)$ and then determine the corresponding values of $g(x)$. Since the range of $f(x)$ is $[0,1]$, we have $f(x) \\in [0,1]$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\n\nNow, since $g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1)$, we have $1 - f(x + 1) \\in [0,1]$. This implies that $f(x + 1) \\in [0,1-0] = [0,1]$. Since $x \\in [0,1]$ and $f(x+1) \\in [0,1]$, we have $x \\in [0,1-1] = [0,0.9]$. However, since $g(x)$ is defined for all $x \\in [0,1]$, we must have $f(x+1) \\in [0,1]$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $[0,1-1] = [0,0] \\cup [0,1] = [0,1]$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered quadruple $(a,b,c,d)$ is $(0,1,0,1)$.", " To find the percentage of pushups in Emmett's exercise routine, we first need to determine the total number of exercises he did. We know he did 12 jumping jacks and x number of sit-ups, so the total number of exercises is 12 + x.\n\nHe did 8 pushups, so the number of pushups is 8.\n\nTo find the percentage of pushups, we divide the number of pushups by the total number of exercises and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage of pushups = (Number of pushups / Total number of exercises) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers we know, we get:\n\nPercentage of pushups = (8 / (12 + x)) * 100\n\nNow, if we know that the percentage of pushups is 20, we can set up the equation:\n\n20 = (8 / (12 + x)) * 100\n\nTo solve for x, we first need to get rid of the percentage sign and the decimal point:\n\n1600 = 8 / (12 + x)\n\nNext, we can cross-multiply:\n\n1600(12 + x) = 8\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation:\n\n19200 + 1600x = 8\n\nSubtracting 19200 from both sides:\n\n1600x = -19192\n\nDividing both sides by 1600:\n\nx = -11964/8\n\nSince x cannot be a negative number, we have made an error in our calculation.

The cost for one flag would be $0.20 (since 5 flags cost $1.00). To find out how many sets of 5 flags they need to buy, we can divide the total number of flags by 5:\n\ntotal flags = flags for guests + flags for hosts\ntotal flags = 41\n\nsets of 5 flags = total flags / 5\nsets of 5 flags = 41 / 5\nsets of 5 flags = 8 sets and 1 flag\n\nSince they can only buy sets of 5 flags, they need to buy 8 sets and 1 individual flag.

An adult panda eats x pounds of bamboo in 1 day\n\nWe also know that a baby panda eats 50 pounds of bamboo each day, and that the pandas together eat 1316 pounds of bamboo in a week. Since we only have information about the amount of bamboo eaten by one adult and one baby panda, we cannot directly determine how many adult and baby pandas there are in this scenario. However, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:\n\n2. The total amount of bamboo eaten by the adult and the baby in 1 week is 1316 pounds.\n3. The adult eats x pounds of bamboo each day, and the baby eats 50 pounds of bamboo each day.\n4. Therefore, the weekly bamboo consumption for the adult is x pounds per day \u00d7 7 days, and the weekly bamboo consumption for the baby is 50 pounds per day \u00d7 7 days.\n5. The total weekly bamboo consumption for both the adult and the baby is x + 50 \u00d7 7 = x + 350.\n6. We know that the total weekly bamboo consumption for both the adult and the baby is 1316 pounds, so we can set up the equation: x + 350 = 1316\n7. Solving for x, we subtract 350 from both sides: x = 966\n\nSo, an adult panda eats 966 pounds of bamboo in a week.

So, the number of pills he takes each day can be represented as:\n\nPills per day = Starting dose + (Daily increase * Number of days)\n                      = 1 + (2 * x)\n\nWe want to find the total number of pills he takes in a week, which is 7 days. So, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\nTotal pills = Pills per day * Number of days\n                 = (1 +2x) * 7\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of days he takes the increased dosage. Since we know that he starts with a dosage of 1 pill and increases by 2 pills each day, we can determine the number of days it takes for him to take 7 pills more than his starting dose:\n\n7 pills (extra) = 2 pills/day * Number of days\nNumber of days = 7 pills / 2 pills/day\n                      = 3.5 days\n\nSince Joey can't take half a pill, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which means he will take the increased dosage for 4 days.\n\nNow we can find the total number of pills he takes in a week:\n\nTotal pills = (1 +2x) * 7\n                 = (1 +2*4) * 7\n                 = (1 + 8) * 7\n                 = 9 * 7\n                 = 63 pills\n\nSo, Joey will have taken a total of 63 pills by the end of the week.", "Jame originally had 60 bars of gold.

The sum of his snatch and clean and jerk weights should equal this total. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nSnatch + Clean and Jerk = Total Lifting Capacity\n\nWe know the clean and jerk, so we can solve for the snatch:\n\nSnatch = Total Lifting Capacity - Clean and Jerk\nSnatch = 250 kg - 160 kg\nSnatch = 90 kg\n\nNow we know that John's snatch increased by x%.

This triangle represents the situation, with the origin as the vertex opposite the right angle.\n\nTo calculate the length of the hypotenuse (the greatest distance from the origin), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nwhere a = 4 units, b = 10 feet = 10 units, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n(4)\u00b2 + (10)\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n16 + 100 = c\u00b2\n116 = c\u00b2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = \u221a116 \u2248 10.75 feet\n\nSo, the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is approximately 10.75 feet.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6 can be found by multiplying the smallest prime factors of both numbers and keeping the highest power of each prime factor:\n\n- The smallest prime factor of 5 is 5 (since 5 is a prime number)\n- The smallest prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1)\n\nMultiplying these prime factors with their highest powers:\n\nLCM(5, 6) = 5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 30\n\nNow we have the LCM of 5 and 6, which is 30. Since July has 31 days, we need to check if the 30th is a multiple of both 5 and 6.\n\n- July 30 is a multiple of 5 (since 30 = 5 \u00d7 6)\n- July 30 is a multiple of 6 (as we've already determined)\n\nSo, the bookstore and the shoe store have a sale on the same date (July 30) in July.\n\nHowever, there's another multiple of 5 and 6 in July:\n\n- July 15 is a multiple of 5 (since 15 = 5 \u00d7 3)\n- July 15 is also a multiple of 6 (since 15 = 3 \u00d7 5)\n\nSo, the bookstore and the shoe store have sales on the same date (July 15) in July as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the bookstore and the shoe store have sales on the same date in July twice: July 15 and July 30.", "Based on the given information that one out of every five Americans has allergies, we can calculate the number of individuals with allergies in a random sample of 250 Americans as follows:\n\nNumber of individuals with allergies = Total number of Americans sampled * Percentage of Americans with allergies\n\nNumber of individuals with allergies = 250 * (1/5)\n\nNumber of individuals with allergies = 250 * 0.2\n\nNumber of individuals with allergies = 50\n\nSo, you would anticipate 50 individuals in a random sample of 250 Americans to suffer from allergies.", " To find the number of students who have both puppies and parrots, we first need to determine how many students have puppies, and then find a percentage of that group who also have parrots.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students have puppies:\n\nNumber of students with puppies = Total number of students * Percentage of students with puppies\nNumber of students with puppies = 40 * 0.8\nNumber of students with puppies = 32\n\nNow, let's find out how many students in this group have both puppies and parrots:\n\nNumber of students with both puppies and parrots = Number of students with puppies * Percentage of students with both\nNumber of students with both puppies and parrots = 32 * 0.25\nNumber of students with both puppies and parrots = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 students in Professor Plum's biology class who have both puppies and parrots.", "1. We know that there are 12 uniforms in the lab.\n2. The number of lab coats is x times the number of uniforms, so the number of lab coats is 12x.\n3. The number of lab techs is half the number of uniforms, so there are 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 lab techs.\n4. Each lab tech gets an equal share of both coats and uniforms. Since there are 6 lab techs, each gets a share of 6 lab techs * (coats + uniforms) = total number of items.\n5. Setting up the equation, we have 6 * (coats + uniforms) = total number of items.\n6. We know that each lab tech gets 14 items in total, so the total number of items is 14 * 6 = <<14*6=84>>84.\n7. Substituting this value into our equation, we get 6 * (coats + 12) = 84.\n8. Solving for coats, we have 6 * coats + 72 = 84, which means coats = (84 - 72) / 6 = 4.\n9. Since the number of lab coats is x times the number of uniforms, and there are 12 uniforms, we have x * 12 = 4 * 12 = 48. Therefore, x = 4.\n\nSo, there are 48 lab coats in the lab.", "To find the number of skips Matt did in x minutes, we first need to convert x minutes to seconds, since Matt skips ropes 3 times per second:\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\nx minutes = x * 60 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of skips Matt did:\n\nNumber of skips = Skips per second * Time (in seconds)\nNumber of skips = 3 skips/second * (x * 60 seconds)\n\nWe're given that the number of skips is 1800. Let's set up the equation and solve for x:\n\n1800 skips = 3 skips/second * (x * 60 seconds)\n\nTo isolate x, we'll divide both sides by (3 * 60):\n\nx = (1800 skips) / (3 skips/second * 60 seconds)\n\nCalculate the divisor:\n3 skips/second * 60 seconds = 180 skips/minute\n\nNow, divide:\nx = (1800 skips) / 180 skips/minute\n\nx \u2248 10 minutes\n\nSo, Matt skipped ropes for approximately 10 minutes to get 1800 skips.", "To find the total number of noodles and pirates in the matrix, we need to find the number of noodles first, which is given as 7 fewer than the number of pirates.

Without knowing the exact number of pirates, we cannot find the specific number of pirates and noodles in the matrix.", "1. Oliver worked out for 4 hours on Monday.\n\n2. He worked out for 2 hours less on Tuesday, so he worked out for 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours on Tuesday.\n\n3. On Wednesday, he exercised for twice as much time as on Monday, so he worked out for 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours on Wednesday.\n\n4. On Thursday, he exercised at home for twice as long as on Tuesday, so he worked out for 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Thursday.\n\n5. To find the total number of hours Oliver worked out during these four days, we add up the hours for each day: 4 hours (Monday) + 2 hours (Tuesday) + 8 hours (Wednesday) + 4 hours (Thursday) = 18 hours.\n\nSo, Oliver worked out for a total of 18 hours during these four days.", "1. To find the boy's speed in minutes per kilometer, we first need to convert his hourly speed to minutes per kilometer.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. The probability of drawing a blue chip first is 5 blue chips out of a total of 8 chips (5 blue + 3 yellow), so it's 5/8.\n2. Since we replace the chip after the first draw, the probabilities don't change for the second draw. So, the probability of drawing a yellow chip next is 3 yellow chips out of 8 total chips, or 3/8.\n3. To find the probability of both events happening (drawing a blue chip and then a yellow chip), we multiply the individual probabilities: (5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64.\n4. To express this probability as a common fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of 15 and 64. The greatest common divisor of 15 and 64 is 1, 3, or 15, but since we want a common fraction, we'll choose 15 as our common denominator: 15/64 = 11/18.\n\nSo, the probability that the two chips drawn are different colors is 11/18.", " To find the maximum area of a rectangle given its perimeter, we need to find the dimensions (length and width) that would give us the largest possible area. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L + W), where L is the length and W is the width. We're given that P = 24 inches.\n\nFirst, let's solve for one of the dimensions in terms of the other. We'll solve for the width (W):\n\n2(L + W) = 24\n2L + 2W = 24\n2L = 24 - 2W\nL = 12 - W\n\nNow, we want to find the width and length that will give us the maximum area. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = LW. Since we found an expression for L in terms of W, we can substitute it into the area formula:\n\nA = (12 - W) * W\n\nTo find the maximum area, we'll take the derivative of this expression with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\ndA/dW = 12 - 2W\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we find:\n\n12 - 2W = 0\n2W = 12\nW = 6 inches\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the corresponding length:\n\nL = 12 - W\nL = 12 - 6\nL = 6 inches\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that will give us the maximum area are 6 inches by 6 inches, and the maximum area is:\n\nA = L * W\nA = 6 * 6\nA = 36 square inches.", "To find the remainder when $2^{87} +3$ is divided by 7, we cannot use simple arithmetic methods, as $2^{87}$ is a very large number. Instead, we can use the fact that $2^{n} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ for any positive integer $n$ if $n$ is a multiple of 3 (this is known as Euler's totient congruence). Since $87 = 3 \\times 29 + 1$, we have $2^{87} \\equiv 1^{3} \\times 2^{29} \\equiv 2^{29} \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, to find $2^{29} \\pmod{7}$, we can use binary powering method.

We know there are 8 red pens.\n2. There are x more black pens than red pens, so there are 8 + x black pens.\n3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens, so there are 8 + 7 = 15 blue pens.\n4. In total, there are 8 (red) + 8 (black) + 15 (blue) = 21 pens of different colors.\n5. However, we were told that there are 41 pens in all.\n6. Therefore, the difference between the actual number of pens and the number of pens of the three colors we have calculated is: 41 - 21 = 20.\n7. Since we have no other information about any other pens, it's reasonable to assume that these extra 20 pens are also red, black, or blue.\n8. To make the total number of pens equal 41, we need to add 20 more pens of one of the colors.\n9. Since adding 20 black or blue pens would result in an odd number of pens for that color, the only option is to add 20 more red pens.\n10. So, there are 8 (original red pens) + 20 (additional red pens) = 28 red pens.\n11. With the given information, the total number of pens should be 8 (red) + 8 (black) + 15 (blue) = 21, but we need to account for the 20 extra red pens.\n12. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable x is: x = 28 (red pens) - 8 (original red pens) = 20.\n\nSo, the value of the unknown variable x is 20.", "1.

So the number of kids denied from Riverside High is: 120 * x/100 = 120x/100 * 1/1 = 1.2x kids. Since we cannot have a fraction of a kid, we'll round up to the nearest whole number: 1.2x \u2248 x kids.\n3. Fern denied 70% of the 90 kids from West Side High. So the number of kids denied from West Side High is: 90 * 70/100 = 63 kids.\n4. Fern denied half of the 50 kids from Mountaintop High. So the number of kids denied from Mountaintop High is: 50/2 = 25 kids.\n5. The total number of kids denied is: x + 63 + 25 = x + 88 kids.\n6. However, 148 kids got into the movie, which is more than the total number of kids in the three high schools (120 + 90 + 50 = 260). So there seems to be a mistake in the given information.\n7. To find the percentage of kids that got into the movie, we need to subtract the number of kids that were denied from the total number of kids and divide by the total number of kids: (260 - (x + 88)) / 260 * 100%.\n8. To find x, we need to solve the equation (260 - x - 88) / 260 = y (where y is the percentage that got in), then multiply the result by 100 and subtract it from 100 to find x: 100 - 100y = x.\n\nSince the given information is inconsistent, it's impossible to determine the exact percentage of kids from each high school that got into the movie based on the given data.", "If Selena's book has 400 pages, then Harry's book has 400 - (0.01x * 400) pages. We are given that Harry's book has 180 pages. Now, we can set up an equation to find the value of x:\n\n400 - (0.01x * 400) = 180\n\nFirst, let's get rid of the decimals by moving the 0.01x term to the other side of the equation:\n\n400 = 180 + 0.01x * 400\n\nNext, we'll divide both sides by 400 to isolate x:\n\n1 = 0.0025x + 0.01 * 0.5\n\nNow, we can solve for x by isolating the x term:\n\nx = (1 - 0.01 * 0.5) / 0.0025\nx = 373.33\n\nSince x is a percentage, we need to convert 373.33 to a percentage. We know that 1% is equal to 1/100, so we can write the equation:\n\nx = 373.33 * (1/100)\nx = 0.3733 or 37.33%\n\nSo, the book that Harry reads is 37.33% the size of Selena's book, which has 400 pages.

We can factor this expression as:\n\n$$x^2+2x+5=(x+1)^2+3$$\n\nSo, $(x+1)^2+3$ is a perfect square plus a constant term, and therefore, it will be an integer for every integer value of $x$.\n\nNow, let's find the integer values of $x-3$. For this, we need to find the integer values of $x$ such that $x-3$ is an integer. In other words, we need to find the integers that satisfy the equation:\n\n$$x=3+n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $x$ in the given fraction, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{(3+n)^2+2(3+n)+5}{3+n-3}=\\frac{(3+n)^2+2(3+n)+5}{n}$$\n\nFor this fraction to be an integer, both the numerator and the denominator must be integers.

The pie shop earns $180 from selling these 60 slices.\n3. Therefore, the cost per slice is C/S, and the cost for 60 slices is 60 * C.\n4. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and solving for C, we get: C = $180 * (1/0.1) = $1800\n5.

So, 10 more students entered the bus.\n3. The total number of students on the bus after the intermediate stop is x + 10.\n4. According to the problem, 40% of the students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop are 58 students. So, the number of students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop is 58 / 0.4 = 145.\n5. However, we started with only x students on the bus before the intermediate stop. So, x + 10 = 145, which gives us x = 135.\n6. Therefore, 40% of the number of students who entered the bus at the intermediate stop is 135 * 0.4 = 54.

So, for 6 cups of weak coffee, he will need:\n\nWeak coffee tablespoons = 6 cups * 1 tablespoon/cup = 6 tablespoons\n\nFor strong coffee, Taylor uses 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup. So, for 6 cups of strong coffee, he will need:\n\nStrong coffee tablespoons = 6 cups * 2 tablespoons/cup = 12 tablespoons\n\nTherefore, Taylor will need a total of 6 tablespoons for weak coffee and 12 tablespoons for strong coffee, which sums up to:\n\nTotal tablespoons of coffee = Weak coffee tablespoons + Strong coffee tablespoons = 6 tablespoons + 12 tablespoons = 18 tablespoons.", " To find the number of kilograms of cabbage Johannes sold today (x), we can set up an equation based on the given information:\n\n1.

Substituting w = 2x in the second equation, we get 2x + f + x = 54.\n5. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of f.

In the case of free expansion, V2 becomes infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial entropy, S1, of the system before the expansion. Since the container walls are assumed to be at temperature T, the entropy of the container and the gas before expansion is given by:\n\nS1 = NkB ln(V1/Vm) + NkB ln(Z)\n\nwhere Vm is the volume occupied by one molecule, and Z is the number of possible configurations of the gas molecules in the initial volume V1.\n\nSince the gas expands into an infinitely large container, the final volume V2 approaches infinity. The final entropy, S2, of the universe is given by:\n\nS2 = NkB ln(V2/Vm)\n\nSince the number of particles N, the temperature T, and the Avogadro constant (N_A = NA/N) are constant during the expansion, we can express the ratio of the final entropy to the initial entropy as:\n\nS2/S1 = (V2/V1) * (Z1/Z2)\n\nThe volume ratio approaches infinity, so the entropy ratio approaches infinity as well. However, since we want to find the increase in entropy to first order in (a'N/VkBT), where a' is the coefficient of thermal expansion, we can expand the entropy ratio using the binomial theorem:\n\nS2/S1 = [(1 + (\u0394V/V1)) * (Z1/Z2)]\n\nwhere \u0394V = a'NVT/V.\n\nTo first order in (a'N/VkBT), we can approximate Z1/Z2 as equal to 1, since the volume change is small:\n\nS2/S1 = 1 + (\u0394V/V1)\n\nSubstituting \u0394V = a'NVT/V, we have:\n\nS2/S1 = 1 + (a'N/VkBT)\n\nTherefore, the increase in entropy of the universe to first order in (a'N/VkBT) is given by:\n\n\u0394S = S2 - S1 = S2 = NkB ln(1 + a'N/VkBT) \u2248 NkB * (a'N/VkBT)\n\nThus, the increase in entropy of the universe to first order in (a'N/VkBT) is given by the expression:\n\n\u0394S \u2248 NkB * (a'N/VkBT)\n\nThis result shows that the increase in entropy of the universe during free expansion is proportional to the number of particles N, the temperature T, and the coefficient of thermal expansion a', and inversely proportional to the initial volume V and the Boltzmann constant kB.", "18 more cheesecakes: 6 * 3 = 18\n\n21 more muffins: 5 * 3 = 15, but since we're looking for the difference, we subtract the original number baked, so 21 - 5 = 16, but since Carter only increased muffins by 11 (16 - 5), we need to add 1 more cake to get the correct answer: 21\n\n16 more red velvet cakes: 8 * 3 = 24, but since we're looking for the difference, we subtract the original number baked, so 24 - 8 = 16.\n\nSo, Carter baked 18 more cheesecakes, 21 more muffins, and 16 more red velvet cakes this week, for a total of 55 more cakes.", " To find the number of snowflakes that were present initially, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's calculate the number of wins, losses, and ties each team should have against the other teams based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of wins, losses, and ties in the league. Since there are 5 teams and each team plays 20 games, the total number of games is $5 \\times 20 = 100$. Since each game has one winner and one loser (or a tie), the total number of wins and losses is also 100. Therefore, there must be $50$ wins for all teams combined.\n\nNow, let's find the number of wins, losses, and ties for each team against the other teams. We know that team A has 2 wins, 15 losses, and 3 ties. So, team A loses to every other team 15 times and ties with two teams 3 times.\n\nLet's call the number of games team B wins against team A $b$, the number of games team C wins against team A $c$, the number of games team D wins against team A $d$, and the number of games team E wins against team A $e$. Then, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nb + c + d + e &= 15 \\text{ (number of losses for team A against team B, C, D, and E)} \\\\\nb + 0 + d + e &= 3 \\text{ (number of ties for team A against team B and E)} \\\\\nb + c + 0 + z &= 7 \\text{ (number of wins for team B against team A)} \\\\\n0 + c + d + y &= 9 \\text{ (number of losses for team C against team A and D)} \\\\\n6 + 0 + 2 + z &= 10 \\text{ (number of wins for team D against team A and C)} \\\\\n0 + 12 + 2 + x &= 8 \\text{ (number of losses for team E against team A and D)}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe have six equations with six variables.

So, $AD=AE+DE=3+5=8$.\n\nUsing the given information about the lengths of the sides, we can write the following relations:\n\n$AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2$\n\n$AC^2 = (3+5)^2 + DC^2$\n\n$AC^2 = 36 + DC^2$\n\nWe know that $DC=CE-DE=7-5=2$.

So, the number of people left with the alien is 200 - 160 = 40 people.\n4. The alien then takes 10 more people to another planet, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 people with him.\n5. However, the question asks for the number of people taken to the alien's home planet, not the number of people left with the alien.\n6.

John spends 1 hour each day lifting weights.\n2. He also spends a third of his lifting time warming up and doing cardio.\n3. Let's find out how long John spends on warming up and doing cardio each day:\n   Warm-up and cardio time = Lifting time * (1/3)\n   = 1 hour * (1/3)\n   = 1 hour / 3 \u2248 0.3333 hours\n4. Since we want to find the total hours John spends at the gym per week, we need to add the lifting time and the warm-up/cardio time:\n   Total gym time per week = (x * 1 hour) + (x * 0.3333 hours)\n5. We are given that the total gym time per week is 4 hours, so we can set up the equation:\n   x * 1 + x * 0.3333 = 4\n6. To solve for x, we can first get rid of the decimals:\n   x * 1 + x * 3/10 = 4\n7. Multiplying both sides by 10 to get rid of the fraction:\n   10x + 3x = 40\n8. Combining like terms:\n   7x = 40\n9. Dividing both sides by 7:\n   x \u2248 5.7143 hours / 7 \u2248 0.82 hours\n10. However, since x represents the number of times John goes to the gym per week, it cannot be a fraction. We need to find an integer value for x that makes the total weekly gym time 4 hours.\n11. Since 0.82 hours is close to 0.5 hours (which would correspond to John going to the gym twice a week), we can try increasing the number of gym visits to see if it results in a total weekly time close to 4 hours.\n12. If John goes to the gym 3 times a week, his total weekly gym time would be:\n   3 * 1.33 hours \u2248 3.99 hours, which is not close to 4 hours.\n13. If John goes to the gym 4 times a week, his total weekly gym time would be:\n   4 * 1.33 hours = 5.32 hours, which is more than 4 hours.\n14.

First, we need to find out how many tickets were bought by the 4th and 5th graders.\n2. We know that 4th graders bought 30% of the total tickets, so we calculate: 30% of 300 tickets = 0.3 * 300 = 90 tickets.\n3. Then, 5th graders bought 50% of the remaining tickets, so we calculate: 50% of (300 - 90) = 0.5 * (210) = 105 tickets.\n4. So far, we have sold a total of 90 + 105 = 195 tickets.\n5. We also know that 6th graders bought a total of 100 tickets.\n6. However, the problem states that there are a total of 30 rolls of tickets with 100 tickets each, so the total number of tickets is 30 * 100 = 3000 tickets.\n7. Therefore, there are 3000 - 195 = 2981 tickets that have been sold.\n8. Since there were 30 rolls of tickets with 100 tickets each, there should be no tickets left unsold. However, the problem states that 10 tickets were left unsold.\n9. This creates a contradiction, so there might be an error in the problem statement.

Since circles $L$ and $O$ are internally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii, i.e., $OC' = T + 4T = 5T$.\n\nSince point $E$ lies on circle $L$ and $\\overline{OE}$ is tangent to circle $L$, the distance from $E$ to $OC'$ is the sum of the radius of circle $L$ and the length of the common tangent $\\overline{OT}$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of $\\overline{OT}$ as follows:\n\n$$ OT^2 = TE^2 + TO'^2 - 2TE \\cdot TO \\cos \\angle TOE $$\n\nSince $\\angle TOE$ is the central angle of circle $L$ corresponding to arc $OE$, we have:\n\n$$ \\angle TOE = \\frac{AE}{LC} \\cdot 360^\\circ = \\frac{4T}{2T} \\cdot 360^\\circ = 180^\\circ $$\n\nThus, $\\cos \\angle TOE = -\\cos 180^\\circ = -1$.

Thus, we can write:\n\n$$ OT^2 = T^2 + (5T)^2 + 2TE \\cdot TO $$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$ OT^2 = T^2 + 25T^2 + 2TE^2 $$\n\n$$ OT^2 = 26T^2 + 2TE^2 $$\n\n$$ OT^2 - 2TE^2 = 26T^2 $$\n\n$$ (OT-TE)(OT+TE) = 26T^2 $$\n\nSince $OT > TE$, we have $OT-TE > 0$ and $OT+TE > 0$, so the factors on the left-hand side must have the same sign. This implies that $OT > TE$.\n\nNow, let's find $TE$. We know that $OE = TE$ and $OE = \\frac{1}{2}LC = \\frac{1}{2}2T = T$.

According to the problem, Toby worked 10 hours less than twice Thomas's hours, so Toby worked x + 10. Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby, so Rebecca worked x + 10 - 8 = x + 2 hours.\n\nThe total number of hours they all worked in one week was 157 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n\nx + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 8) = 157\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3x + 12 = 157\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\n3x = 145\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 145/3 \u2248 48.33\n\nSince the number of hours worked must be a whole number, it's clear that there is an error in the problem statement.

We're given that each s'more takes x graham crackers and one marshmallow.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that Jacob has 48 graham crackers and 6 marshmallows. Let's calculate how many s'mores he has made:\n\nTotal number of s'mores = Total number of graham crackers / Graham crackers per s'more\n                                       = 48 / x\n\nSince he also has 6 marshmallows, we can calculate how many marshmallows he has used:\n\nTotal number of marshmallows used = Number of s'mores * Marshmallows per s'more\n                                                  = (48 / x) * 1\n\nWe know that he needs to buy 18 more marshmallows, so:\n\nTotal number of marshmallows needed = Total number of marshmallows used + Marshmallows to be bought\n                                                    = (48 / x) + 18\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x such that the equation above is true. Unfortunately, without more information, it's impossible to determine a unique value for x based on the given data. The number of graham crackers and marshmallows Jacob has doesn't give us enough information to find the number of graham crackers used in one s'more.\n\nIf you have more information about the size of the graham crackers or the size of the marshmallows, that could help determine the value of x. For example, if you know that each graham cracker sheet contains 4 individual graham crackers, then x = 1. If you know that each marshmallow is square-shaped and covers an area of 1 square inch, and the graham crackers form a square with an area of 6 square inches, then x = 3. In general, you would need two pieces of independent information to determine x.", "First, let's determine how many 90-minute intervals are in 6 hours of work.

Complete the square for x:\n   $x^2 - 2x = (x^2-2x+1) + 1$\n   $x^2-2x+1 = (x-1)^2$\n\n2. Complete the square for y:\n   $y^2 - 4y = (y^2-4y+16) + 16$\n   $y^2-4y+16 = (y-2)^2$\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n$(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 + 16-28 = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = -12$\n\nNow, we can see that the center of the circle is at (-1, 2) and the radius is $\\sqrt{12}=2\\sqrt{3}$.", " To find the positive value of $n$ for which the equation $4x^2+nx+25=0$ has exactly one solution, we need to apply the quadratic formula and check the number of solutions.

We know that 24 out of every 60 individuals like football.\n2. This means that 24 represents 40% of the group of 60 since 24 is 40% of 60.\n3. However, the question asks for the number of people who play football among the 250 individuals in the group.\n4. To find the number of people who play football, we need to find 40% of the total group size (250) and then multiply it by 1.5 (since each person who likes football has a 50% chance of playing).\n5. First, find 40% of 250: 0.4 * 250 = 100\n6. Then, multiply by 1.5: 100 * 1.5 = 150\n7. However, since each person who likes football has a 50% chance of playing, we need to divide the result by 2 to get the actual number of people playing football: 150 / 2 = 100\n\nTherefore, 100 people are expected to play football.", " A regular polygon has diagonals connecting opposite vertices. In a regular polygon with n sides, there are n-2 such diagonals. So if a polygon has nine diagonals, then it has:\n\nn = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nHowever, this doesn't make much sense in the context of a regular polygon because a regular polygon with eleven sides (an eleven-gon) is not commonly recognized. The smallest regular polygon with nine diagonals is a quadrangular dodecagon (a twelve-sided polygon with four sets of diagonals connecting the corners of two squares inscribed in it).\n\nSo, it's important to note that a polygon with nine diagonals does exist but it's not a regular one.", " To find the values of $x$ that make the denominator of the given rational function equal to zero, we need to solve the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.

Since we know that there are 12 packs, we can set up an equation:\n\n3020 grams = 12 * (250 grams + x)\n\nFirst, we need to isolate the term with x on one side of the equation:\n\n3020 grams = 12 * (250 grams + x)\n3020 grams = 12 * 250 grams + 12 * x\n3020 grams = 3000 grams + 12 * x\n\nNow we need to find the value of x:\n\n12 * x = 200 grams\nx = 200 grams / 12\nx = 16.67 grams (approximately)\n\nSince the weight of sugar in a pack must be a whole number, it seems that there might be an error in the problem statement, as the result is not a whole number. If we assume that the weight of sugar in a pack is 250 grams exactly, then the store would have started with slightly more than 12 packs of sugar. In that case, the store owner might have had to discard a small amount of sugar that couldn't be divided evenly into 12 packs.

The relationship between temperature, pressure, and refractive index is given by the Legendre-Todd relationship:\n\n$$n-1=\\frac{7.48\\times 10^{-3}}{T+273.15}\\left(1+\\frac{0.0078\\times 10^{-3}}{T+273.15}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $T$ is temperature in Kelvin.\n\nUsing the given temperature of $15{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (or $288.15 \\mathrm{K}$), we can find the refractive indices at the two heights:\n\n$$n_1=1.000276$$ (given)\n\n$$n_2=\\frac{T_2+273.15}{T_1+273.15}n_1$$\n\nSolving for $T_2$, we get:\n\n$$T_2=30{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}=30+273.15=303.15 \\mathrm{K}$$\n\nNow we can use the given relationship between refractive index and density to find the densities at the two heights:\n\n$$\\rho=\\frac{M}{R\\cdot T}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}-\\frac{1}{1}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $M$ is the molar mass of air ($0.02897 \\mathrm{kg/mol}$), $R$ is the gas constant ($8.314 \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$), and $n$ is the refractive index.\n\nUsing the densities and the given height difference, we can find the temperature difference using the hydrostatic equation:\n\n$$\\rho_1g\\cdot\\Delta h=\\rho_2(\\Delta h+h_1)g$$\n\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 \\mathrm{m/s^2}$), $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$ are the densities at the two heights, $\\Delta h$ is the height difference ($1.60 \\mathrm{m}$), and $h_1$ is the height of the first layer of air above the ground ($0.016 \\mathrm{m}$ or $1.6 \\mathrm{cm}$).\n\nSolving for $\\Delta T$, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta T=\\frac{1.60 \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\frac{0.02897 \\mathrm{kg/mol}}{8.314 \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(n_1-1)-(n_2-1)}}{9.81 \\mathrm{m/s^2}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta T\\approx 1.3{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the air close to the ground is approximately:\n\n$$T_1=T_2-\\Delta T\\approx 291.9{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nThis result is not physically meaningful, as it is below the freezing point of air. This suggests that there may be an error in the given data or assumptions. The large difference in temperature between the two layers of air may not be realistic, especially given the small height difference and the relatively small temperature difference between the two layers of air.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes that the temperature and pressure are the only factors affecting the refractive index, while other factors such as humidity and altitude can also have significant effects. Additionally, the assumption of constant temperature and pressure above $1 \\mathrm{m}$ may not be accurate, as temperature and pressure often vary with height in the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the accuracy of this result is low, and it should be interpreted with caution. A more accurate calculation would require more detailed information about the atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and pressure profiles and humidity data.", "To find out how many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day, we first need to determine how many doughnuts were sold and how many doughnuts were made in total.\n\nWe know that:\n1 box = 10 doughnuts\n27 boxes were sold\n300 doughnuts were made\n\nTo find the number of doughnuts sold, we can multiply the number of boxes sold by the number of doughnuts in each box:\n\nDoughnuts sold = Number of boxes * Doughnuts per box\n= 27 boxes * 10 doughnuts/box\n= 270 doughnuts\n\nNow, we can find the number of doughnuts given away by subtracting the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made:\n\nDoughnuts given away = Total doughnuts made - Doughnuts sold\n= 300 doughnuts - 270 doughnuts\n= 30 doughnuts\n\nTherefore, the bakery gives away 30 doughnuts at the end of the day.", " To find the value of X, we need to find the amount by which X was originally, before it was increased by 120%. Let's call this original amount \"Y\". We know that the increased amount is 110, and the increase was 120%.\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the relationship between X, Y, and the percentage increase:\n\nX = Y + (Y * Percentage Increase)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the percentage increase to a decimal. 120% = 1.2.\n\nX = Y + (Y * 1.2)\n\nNow, we know that X = 110, so we can set up the equation:\n\n110 = Y + (Y * 1.2)\n\nTo solve for Y, we can first get Y on one side of the equation by subtracting Y from both sides:\n\n110 - Y = Y * 1.2\n\nNext, we can solve for Y by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n110 - Y = 1.2 * Y\n\nTo get Y alone, we can subtract Y from both sides:\n\n0.2 * Y = 110 - Y\n\nNow, we can solve for Y by adding Y to both sides:\n\n1.2 * Y = 110\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 1.2 to find the value of Y:\n\nY = 110 / 1.2\n\nY = 91.67\n\nTherefore, the value of X, which is the original amount before the 120% increase, is 91.67.", "To find the number of visitors who did not fall ill, we first need to determine how many visitors became ill. We know that 40 percent of the initial 500 visitors fell ill.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of visitors who fell ill:\n\nVisitors who fell ill = Initial number of visitors * Percentage of visitors who fell ill\n                                 = 500 * 0.4\n                                 = 500 * 0.04\n                                 = 200\n\nNow, we can find the number of visitors who did not fall ill by subtracting the number of sick visitors from the initial number of visitors:\n\nVisitors who did not fall ill = Initial number of visitors - Visitors who fell ill\n                                            = 500 - 200\n                                            = 300\n\nSo, 300 visitors did not fall ill.", "Let's denote the number of students from the second school as x. According to the problem, the first school has twice as many students as the second school, so the number of students from the first school is 2x.\n\nWe know that the third school had 200 students, so:\n\nNumber of students from the second school = x\nNumber of students from the first school = 2x\n\nSince the first school has twice as many students as the second school, we can write the relationship between the number of students from the first and second schools as:\n\n2x = x + d\n\nwhere d represents the difference in the number of students between the first and second schools. Solving for d, we get:\n\nd = x\n\nSo, the number of students from the first school is 3x, and the total number of students from both the first and second schools is:\n\nTotal students from the first and second schools = x + 3x = 4x\n\nWe know that there are 200 students from the third school, so the total number of students who shook the mayor's hand is:\n\nTotal number of students = Students from the second school + Students from the first school + Students from the third school\n\nTotal number of students = x + 4x + 200\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nTotal number of students = 5x + 200\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for x, we can't determine the exact number of students who shook the mayor's hand. However, we have a formula for calculating the total number of students based on the number of students from the second school.", " To find the product of the roots of the given cubic equation $x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x + 28 = 0$, we need to first find its roots. \n\nOne approach to finding the roots of a polynomial equation is by using the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that if all the coefficients of the polynomial are integers, then any rational root must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is an integer that divides the constant term, and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn our case, the constant term is $28$, which is not divisible by any small integers. However, we can try to find possible rational roots by factoring the coefficients:\n\n$x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x + 28 = x^3 + 4x^2 + 12x + 7x^2 + 12x + 28$\n\n$= x(x^2 + 4x + 7) + 14(x^2 + 12)$\n\nWe can see that $x=-7$ is a root, since $7$ is a factor of the constant term $28$. Now we can factor the remaining quadratic terms:\n\n$x^2 + 4x + 7 = (x+1.5)(x+2.5)$\n\nThus, the roots of the polynomial are $x=-7, -1.5,$ and $-2.5$. To find their product, we simply multiply their values:\n\n$(-7) \\times (-1.5) \\times (-2.5) = 7 \\times 1.5 \\times 2.5 = 17.5 \\times 2.5 = 43.75$\n\nSo, the product of the roots of the equation $x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x + 28 = 0$ is $43.75$.", "First, let's find out how many stickers Steven has. We know that he has thrice as many stickers as Ryan, and Ryan has 30 stickers:\n\nSteven's stickers = 3 * Ryan's stickers\nSteven's stickers = 3 * 30\nSteven's stickers = 90\n\nNext, we know that Terry has 20 more stickers than Steven. So, we can find Terry's sticker count by adding 20 to Steven's count:\n\nTerry's stickers = Steven's stickers + 20\nTerry's stickers = 90 + 20\nTerry's stickers = 110\n\nFinally, to find the total number of stickers they have altogether, we add the sticker counts for Ryan, Steven, and Terry:\n\nTotal stickers = Ryan's stickers + Steven's stickers + Terry's stickers\nTotal stickers = 30 + 90 + 110\nTotal stickers = 230.", "132 square feet\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Find the area of the entire fenced region: 15 feet * 12 feet = 180 square feet.\n2. Subtract the area of the square cut out: 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet.\n3. The area of the region within the fence is the difference between the total area and the area of the cut-out: 180 square feet - 9 square feet = 171 square feet.\n4. However, the question asks for the area in square feet, not square inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we need to convert the area to square inches and then divide by 12 to get the area in square feet.\n5. The area of the entire region in square inches is 180 * 12 * 12 = 288,960 square inches.\n6. The area of the cut-out in square inches is 9 * 12 * 12 = 13,824 square inches.\n7. The area of the region within the fence in square inches is 288,960 - 13,824 = 275,136 square inches.\n8. The area of the region within the fence in square feet is 275,136 / 12 / 12 = 132 square feet.", "1. Amber worked for 12 hours.\n\n2.

Since the perimeter of a square is equal to 4 times the length of one side, we can calculate the side length as follows:\n\nSide length of square I = Perimeter / 4\n                                     = 12 units / 4\n                                     = 3 units\n\nSide length of square II = Perimeter / 4\n                                     = 24 units / 4\n                                     = 6 units\n\nNow that we have the side lengths, we can calculate the areas of regions I and III:\n\nArea of region I = Side length of square I ^ 2\n                         = 3 units ^ 2\n                         = 9 square units\n\nArea of region III = Side length of square III ^ 2\n                          = 6 units ^ 2\n                          = 36 square units\n\nThe ratio of the areas of regions I and III is:\n\nArea of region I / Area of region III = 9 square units / 36 square units\n                                               = 1 / 4\n\nSo the ratio of the areas of regions I and III is 1:4.", "To find the number of cases Harper needs to buy to last her 240 days, we first need to determine how many bottles are in one case and how many days one case will last her.\n\nWe know that Harper drinks 1/2 bottle of mineral water per day, so one bottle lasts her two days. Therefore, the number of bottles in one case must be a multiple of two since she can only buy mineral water in whole bottle quantities.\n\nLet's call the number of bottles in one case x. Then, the number of days one case lasts Harper is x/2.\n\nWe know that Harper wants to last for 240 days, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx/2 * number of cases = 240\n\nWe also know that the price of one case is $12.00, so the total cost will be the number of cases multiplied by the price per case:\n\nTotal cost = number of cases * $12.00\n\nWe want to find the number of cases, so we'll solve for it:\n\nnumber of cases = Total cost / $12.00\n\nNow, we know that Harper spends $60 on mineral water, so we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\nnumber of cases = $60 / $12.00\nnumber of cases = 5\n\nSince we know that the number of bottles in one case must be a multiple of two, the only possible value for x is 10, as 10 is the smallest even number that, when divided by 2, will give us a whole number for the number of days one case lasts (5 days).
