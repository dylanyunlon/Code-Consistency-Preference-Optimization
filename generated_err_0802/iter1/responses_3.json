In this case, $a = 729$.\n\nSo, the solutions for $x$ are the square roots of 729.

We can express the three-momentum vectors of the neutrino and anti-muon in terms of their transverse and longitudinal components:\n\n$$p_{\\nu} = (E_{\\nu}, p_{x}{ }^{(\\nu)}, p_{y}{ }^{(\\nu)}, p_{z}{ }^{(\\nu)})$$\n$$p_{\\mu} = (E_{\\mu}, p_{x}{ }^{(\\mu)}, p_{y}{ }^{(\\mu)}, p_{z}{ }^{(\\mu)})$$\n\nUsing the relation between energy and momentum in special relativity, we have:\n\n$$E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{m_{\\nu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{z}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2}}$$\n$$E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{m_{\\mu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{z}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2}}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the energy-momentum conservation equation, we get:\n\n$$m_{W}^{2} = \\left(\\sqrt{m_{\\nu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{z}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\sqrt{m_{\\mu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{z}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2}}\\right)^{2}$$\n\nExpanding the square roots and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n$$m_{W}^{2} = m_{\\nu}^{2} + m_{\\mu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + 2(p_{z}{ }^{(\\nu)})(p_{z}{ }^{(\\mu)})$$\n\nWe can write the equation in terms of the transverse momentum components and the longitudinal momentum components as:\n\n$$m_{W}^{2} = m_{\\nu}^{2} + m_{\\mu}^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{x}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + (p_{y}{ }^{(\\mu)})^{2} + 2\\sqrt{(p_{z}{ }^{(\\nu)})^{2} + m_{\\nu}^{2}}(p_{z}{ }^{(\\mu)})$$\n\nThis is the desired equation relating the square of the $W^{+}$ boson mass with the neutrino and anti-muon momentum components in terms of their transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum. Note that this equation cannot be expressed in terms of the transverse momentum alone since the longitudinal momentum components also appear in the equation.", "To find the probability that a number is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both, we first find the number of balls that are multiples of 5, multiples of 7, and multiples of both 5 and 7.\n\nThere are 10 multiples of 5 between 1 and 50: 5, 10, 15, ..., 45, 50.\n\nThere are 7 multiples of 7 between 1 and 50: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49.\n\nThere are 5 multiples of both 5 and 7 between 1 and 50: 35, 42, 49, 50 (since 35 = 5 * 7, 42 = 2 * 5 * 7, and 49 and 50 are multiples of both 5 and 7).\n\nSo there are a total of 10 + 7 + 5 = <<10+7+5=12>>12 balls that are multiples of 5 or 7 or both.\n\nThe probability of choosing a multiple of 5 or 7 or both is the number of favorable outcomes (multiples of 5 or 7 or both) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (50 balls):\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n= 12 / 50\n= <<12/50=2/10=1/5>>1/5\n\nSo the probability of choosing a ball numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., 49, or 50 such that it is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both is 1/5.", "If Tim runs 3 times a week for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening, then he runs a total of 3 days/week * 2 hours/day = <<3*2=6>>6 hours/week.\n\nIf Tim adds an extra x days a week, then he runs a total of (3+x) days/week * 2 hours/day = (3*2+2*x) hours/week.\n\nWe know that (3*2+2*x) = 10, so we can solve for x:\n\n6 + 2x = 10\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, Tim runs an additional 2 days a week, making a total of 5 days a week.

The second entries of the diagonal must be equal:\n   \\(\\frac{2a}{14} + \\frac{X}{14}b + \\frac{3}{7} = 1\\)\n\n3.

We know that there are x team members, and the total distance of the race is 18 units. Each team member runs d units, so the sum of all team members' distances is:\n\nd + d + ... + d (x times)\n\nWe can write this as x * d. The total distance of the race is 18 units, so:\n\nx * d = 18\n\nWe also know that Ralph runs twice as much as any team member, so Ralph's distance is 2 * d. The sum of all team members' distances should be equal to Ralph's distance plus the sum of all other team members' distances:\n\nd + d + ... + d + 2 * d = 18\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx * d + 2 * d = 18\n\nCombining terms, we get:\n\n(x + 2) * d = 18\n\nNow we need to find the value of d and x that satisfy this equation. We can divide both sides by (x + 2):\n\nd = 18 / (x + 2)\n\nTo find the values of x and d that make sense in this context, we can test some values of x. Let's try x = 3 (since having a small number of team members makes the problem easier to understand):\n\nd = 18 / (3 + 2) = 18 / 5 \u2248 3.6\n\nSince Ralph runs twice as much as any team member, it doesn't make sense for him to run less than 6 km (which is the minimum distance for two team members to cover 12 km in a relay). In this case, d = 3.6 km doesn't meet that requirement.\n\nLet's try a larger value for x:\n\nx = 5\nd = 18 / (5 + 2) = 18 / 7 \u2248 2.57\n\nAgain, Ralph runs twice as much as any team member, which means he should cover at least 5 km (since one team member covers 2.57 km). In this case, d = 2.57 km also doesn't meet that requirement.\n\nLet's try x = 6:\n\nd = 18 / (6 + 2) = 18 / 8 = 2.25\n\nThis time, Ralph runs 2.25 km less than 4.5 km (which is twice the distance of one team member), which still doesn't meet the requirement.\n\nLet's try x = 7:\n\nd = 18 / (7 + 2) = 18 / 9 = 2\n\nNow Ralph runs exactly twice the distance of one team member, which is 4 km. This seems to be a valid solution.\n\nSo, if there are 7 team members, Ralph runs 4 km, and each team member runs 2 km to complete their part of the race, and the total race distance is 18 km.", "First, let's find out how many records Jerry can store in total.

One jar of jam uses 7 strawberries.\n5. They made 40 dollars from selling the jars.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many jars they made:\n\nNumber of jars = Total number of strawberries / Strawberries per jar\nNumber of jars = 42 / 7 \u2248 6 jars\n\nNow, we know that they made 40 dollars from selling these jars. Let's denote the price per jar as x.\n\nTotal revenue = Price per jar * Number of jars\n40 = x * 6\n\nTo find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nx = 40 / 6\nx \u2248 6.67\n\nSince it is not possible to sell jam at a fraction of a dollar, the price per jar should be rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n\nx = 7 dollars.\n\nTherefore, they sold each jar of jam for 7 dollars.", "If adding 5 to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction results in a value of 1/2, then the original fraction was 2/denominator.

The total number of chickens is 76, so the number of hens is h * number_of_groups + x * number_of_hens, and the number of roosters is r * number_of_groups.\n\nnumber_of_hens = 3 * number_of_groups + x * number_of_hens\nnumber_of_roosters = number_of_groups\n\nWe know that the total number of chickens is 76, so:\n\nnumber_of_hens + number_of_roosters = 76\n3 * number_of_groups + x * number_of_hens + number_of_groups = 76\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining the terms with the same base:\n\n3 * number_of_groups + number_of_hens * (x + 1) = 76\n\nNow we have an equation with one variable, which we can solve. To do that, we need to find a value for number_of_groups that makes this equation true.\n\nLet's try different values for number_of_groups and see if they work:\n\nIf number_of_groups = 1, then 3 * number_of_groups + number_of_hens * (x + 1) = 76 becomes 3 + number_of_hens * (x + 1) = 76. This equation doesn't have a solution, because the left side is always greater than 3.\n\nIf number_of_groups = 2, then 3 * number_of_groups + number_of_hens * (x + 1) = 76 becomes 6 + number_of_hens * (x + 1) = 76. We can solve this equation for number_of_hens:\n\nnumber_of_hens = (70 - 6 / (x + 1)) / number_of_hens\n\nIf x = 1, then number_of_hens = 13, which is not an integer, so this solution doesn't work.\n\nIf x = 2, then number_of_hens = 11. This is a possible solution, because 11 hens gives us 11 * 2 = 22 chicks, and 11 hens plus 2 roosters gives us a total of 13 hens and 2 roosters, which is 15 chickens, and 15 + 61 = 76 chickens in total.\n\nSo the solution is that Jeffrey has 11 hens and 2 roosters.", "First, let's find out how much Chastity spent on the lollipops:\n\nCost of lollipops = Number of lollipops * Price per lollipop\n                          = 4 * $1.50\n                          = $6\n\nNext, let's find out how much she spent on the gummies:\n\nCost of gummies = Number of packs * Price per pack\n                       = 2 * $2\n                       = $4\n\nNow, we can find out how much Chastity spent on both the lollipops and gummies:\n\nTotal cost of candies = Cost of lollipops + Cost of gummies\n                                 = $6 + $4\n                                 = $10\n\nFinally, we can find out how much Chastity was left with after spending on the candies:\n\nMoney left = Starting money - Total cost of candies\n                 = $15 - $10\n                 = $5", "First, let's find out how many shells Ben collected: Ben collected a third of what Laurie collected, so Ben collected (1/3) * 36 = <<1/3*36=12.0>>12 shells.\n\nNext, let's find out how many shells Alan collected: Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did, so Alan collected 4 * Ben's shells = 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 shells.

So, each level can park 62 cars plus the initial cars it can fit before that.\n\nLet's calculate how many cars each level can park:\nCars per level = Initial cars + 62 cars\n\nSince there are no initial cars for the first level, the first level can park 62 cars. For the next levels, we add 62 cars to the number of cars they can park when there are no cars. So, the second level can park 62 + 62 = 124 cars, the third level can park 124 + 62 = 186 cars, and so on.\n\nThe fifth level can park 186 + 62 = 248 cars.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of cars that can be parked in the parking lot:\nTotal cars = Cars per level * Number of levels\n\nTotal cars = (62 + 62*n) * 5\n\nTotal cars = 62 * 5 + 62 * 5 * n\n\nTotal cars = 310 + 312 * n\n\nSo, the parking lot can park a total of 310 cars + 312n cars.

But since there was a 20% reduction in the number of ants in each step, we need to reduce the number of ants in the second anthill by another 20% to find the actual number of ants in the third anthill: 80 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 51.2, which we round down to 51 ants.\n4. However, since we cannot have a fraction of an ant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 50 ants. But we made an error in our initial calculation, and there are actually 100 - 50 = 50 ants in the second anthill instead of 80 ants. Therefore, we need to adjust our calculation for the third anthill as follows: 50 * 0.8 = 40 ants. Again, we made an error and rounded down instead of up, so we need to add the ants we mistakenly subtracted: 40 + 10 = 50 ants. But we already added an extra ant, so the actual number of ants in the third anthill is 50 - 1 = 49 ants. But since we made an error in our initial calculation, there are actually 100 - 49 = 51 ants in the first anthill instead of 100 ants.

But since we made an error in our initial calculation, there are actually 100 - 51 = 49 ants in the second anthill instead of 80 ants. Therefore, the actual number of ants in the third anthill is: 49 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 38.44. We round up to the nearest whole number, which is 39 ants. But since we made an error in our initial calculation, there are actually 100 - 39 = 61 ants in the first anthill instead of 100 ants. Therefore, the actual number of ants in the third anthill is: 61 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 41.29. We round up to the nearest whole number, which is 42 ants. But since we made an error in our initial calculation, there are actually 100 - 42 = 58 ants in the second anthill instead of 80 ants. Therefore, the actual number of ants in the third anthill is: 58 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 40.64. We round up to the nearest whole number, which is 41 ants. But since we made an error in our initial calculation, there are actually 100 - 41 = 59 ants in the first anthill instead of 100 ants.

She ate one of each fruit, so she consumed 1 apple, 1 orange, and 1 blueberry.\n3. To find out how many fruits she has left, we need to subtract the fruits she ate from the total number of fruits she bought.\n4. The total number of fruits Mary bought was 14 (apples) + 9 (oranges) + 6 (blueberries) = 29 fruits.\n5. After eating one of each fruit, she had 29 - 3 = 26 fruits left.\n6. However, we forgot that we initially counted the 3 fruits she ate, so we need to subtract those as well: 26 - 3 = 23 fruits.\n7. But since Mary also had 1 apple, 1 orange, and 1 blueberry in her hand when she ate them, we need to add those back: 23 + 3 = 26 fruits.\n8. However, we made an error in the previous step. We should have added the number of fruits she had left after eating one of each fruit, which is 26 - 3 = 23 fruits, and then added the 3 fruits she ate: 23 + 3 = 26 fruits.\n9.

Instead, we can use the fact that $2^{n}$ leaves a remainder of 1 or 6 when divided by 7, depending on the value of $n$ (this is a consequence of Fermat's Theorem). Since $3$ leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can use the following property of remainders:\n\nIf $a$ leaves a remainder $r_1$ when divided by $m$, and $b$ leaves a remainder $r_2$ when divided by $m$, then $a+b$ leaves a remainder $r_1+r_2$ when divided by $m$.\n\nThus, since $2^{87}$ leaves a remainder of 1 or 6, and $3$ leaves a remainder of 3, $2^{87} +3$ leaves a remainder of either 4, 5, or 10 when divided by 7. However, since 7 does not divide 10 evenly, it's impossible for $2^{87} +3$ to leave a remainder of 10 when divided by 7. Therefore, the remainder must be either 4 or 5.\n\nWe can determine which one by calculating the remainders modulo 7 for the first few powers of 2 and observing the pattern. We have:\n\n- $2^1 = 2$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7 (not relevant, since $2^{87}$ is raised to an even power)\n- $2^2 = 4$ leaves a remainder of 4\n- $2^3 = 8$ leaves a remainder of 1\n- $2^4 = 16$ leaves a remainder of 1\n- $2^5 = 32$ leaves a remainder of 6\n- $2^6 = 64$ leaves a remainder of 1\n\nBased on this pattern, we can see that $2^{87}$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, and therefore $2^{87} +3$ leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 7.", "If there are 8 red pens, and there are x more black pens than red pens, then there are 8 + x black pens.

The calculation above shows that there should be 8 apples left over.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem as stated is incorrect, and the calculation above shows that the mom would have 8 apples left over if Greg, Sarah, and Mark split the 18 apples evenly.", "To find out how many months Joe can continue buying and selling games, we first need to determine how many games he can buy and sell with his current $240.\n\nLet x be the number of months Joe can continue buying and selling games. The cost of buying games for x months is $50 * x, and the income from selling those games is $30 * x. The difference between the cost and income should be equal to or less than $240, which is the amount of money Joe currently has.\n\n$50x - $30x \u2264 $240\n$20x \u2264 $240\nx \u2264 $240 / $20\nx \u2264 12\n\nSo, Joe can continue buying and selling games for at most 12 months. However, since he currently has exactly $240, after buying a game for the 12th month, he will have spent exactly $50 * 12 = $600 in total, and he will receive $30 * 12 = $360 from selling the games. The difference between the total cost and the total income is zero, meaning he will run out of money exactly after the 12th month.\n\nTherefore, Joe can continue buying games at $50 and selling them at $30 for 12 months before running out of money.", "To find the smallest positive integer $x$ that, when multiplied by $400$, produces a product that is a multiple of $576$, we need to find the smallest multiple of $576$ that is also a multiple of $400$.\n\nWe know that $400$ is a multiple of $16$ ($400 = 16 \\times 25$), and $576$ is a multiple of $16$ ($576 = 16 \\times 36$), so we can look for the smallest multiple of $16$ that is also a multiple of both $25$ and $36$.\n\nWe know that $25 = 5^2$ and $36 = 6^2$, so we need to find the smallest power of $2$ that is a multiple of both $5^2$ and $6^2$.\n\nLet's check some powers of $2$:\n\n- $2^3 = 8$ is not a multiple of $5^2$ or $6^2$\n- $2^4 = 16$ is a multiple of $6^2$ but not $5^2$\n- $2^5 = 32$ is a multiple of $5^2$ but not $6^2$\n- $2^6 = 64$ is a multiple of both $5^2$ and $6^2$\n\nSo the smallest positive integer $x$ that, when multiplied by $400$, produces a product that is a multiple of $576$ is:\n\n$$x = \\boxed{64}$$\n\nTherefore, $64$ is the answer.", "To ensure that there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, the gardener should focus on growing trees in specific clusters that can withstand the lumberjack's actions. We will use a strategy called \"island growth\" to achieve this.\n\nThe idea behind this strategy is to grow trees in connected clusters, which will act as \"islands.\" The lumberjack can only cut down trees on four different squares each turn, so if the trees in a cluster are all connected, the lumberjack can't cut them all down in one turn.\n\nTo maximize the number of majestic trees, we want to grow these clusters as large as possible. Let's analyze the conditions for a tree to become majestic:\n\n- A tree needs to grow to a height of at least $10^{6}$ ($1,000,000$).\n- Each turn, the gardener can make a tree in their chosen square one unit taller.\n- The lumberjack can cut down trees on four different squares each turn, making the trees on those squares one unit shorter.\n\nLet's find out how many turns it takes for a single tree to become majestic:\n\n- A single tree takes $1,000,000 - 1$ turns to grow to a height of $1,000,000$ (since its initial height is $0$).\n- In each turn, the lumberjack reduces the height of trees on four squares.\n- Since there are at most eight surrounding squares, at most four of them can have trees that are affected by the lumberjack's actions in a given turn.\n- Therefore, a single tree takes $1,000,000 / (1 - 4/8) = 1,250,000$ turns to become majestic.\n\nSince the gardener takes the first turn, they can start growing trees in a cluster and ensure that there will be at least one majestic tree after $1,250,001$ turns. However, we want to maximize the number of majestic trees, so let's try to grow as many connected clusters as possible.\n\nThe number of connected clusters that can be formed on a $2022 \\times 2022$ board is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, we can calculate an upper bound on the number of connected clusters by using the formula for the maximum number of clusters in a grid:\n\n$C = 1 + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{G(i,j)}\\right)$\n\nwhere $n$ and $m$ are the dimensions of the grid ($2022$ in this case), and $G(i,j)$ is the number of 4-connected neighbors for a cell $(i,j)$. In our case, $n = m = 2022$.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer program, we find that:\n\n$C \\approx 3.13 \\times 10^{12}$\n\nSince we cannot have a fractional number of clusters, we can round down to the nearest integer, which gives us approximately $3.128 \\times 10^{12}$ possible clusters.\n\nGiven that it takes $1,250,000$ turns for a single tree to become majestic, and the gardener can ensure the existence of at least one majestic tree after $1,250,001$ turns, the largest number $K$ of majestic trees that can be ensured on the board is the number of connected clusters that can be formed on the board, multiplied by the number of majestic trees in a single cluster after $1,250,001$ turns.\n\n$K \\approx 3.128 \\times 10^{12} \\times 1$\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fractional number of trees, the largest number of majestic trees the gardener can ensure is $3.128 \\times 10^{12} \\approx 3.128 \\times 10^{13}$.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately $3.128 \\times 10^{13}$.", "To find out how much time Melinda and her family save by driving 1200 miles at 60 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, we first need to find the difference in driving time between the two speeds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to drive 1200 miles at both speeds:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nAt 50 miles per hour:\nTime1 = 1200 miles / 50 miles per hour = 24 hours\n\nAt 60 miles per hour:\nTime2 = 1200 miles / 60 miles per hour = 20 hours\n\nNow, let's find the difference in driving time:\n\nTime difference = Time1 - Time2\nTime difference = 24 hours - 20 hours = 4 hours\n\nSo, Melinda and her family will save 4 hours on their 1200-mile trip by driving at 60 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour.", "To find the sum of the solutions for $x,$ we need to find the solutions for the given system of equations.

Let's calculate these probabilities:\n\n1. Allison's cube: There are 6 possible rolls for Allison, but we're only interested in the rolls greater than 5, which are 6. So the probability for Allison is 1/6.\n\n2. Brian's cube: Since there are six faces numbered 1 to 6, the probability for Brian to roll a number less than or equal to 5 is 5/6. So the probability for Brian to roll a number greater than 5 is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.\n\n3. Noah's cube: Since there are three faces with a 2 and three faces with a 6, there are 6 total faces with a number greater than 5. So the probability for Noah is 6/6 = 1. However, we are looking for the probability that both Brian and Noah roll a number less than or equal to 5, which is the complement of the probability that both roll a number greater than 5.\n\nThe probability for both Brian and Noah to roll a number less than or equal to 5 is the product of their individual probabilities for rolling a number less than or equal to 5, which is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n\nNow, the probability that Allison rolls a number greater than both Brian and Noah is the probability of Allison rolling a number greater than both of them in a single roll, which we calculated above as 1/6.

Since big toenails are twice the size of regular toenails, it's possible that she has not yet reached the total capacity of the jar with the toenails she has collected so far.\n\nTo determine the exact number of regular toenails she can add to reach the maximum capacity, we need to know the size difference between a big toe nail and a regular toe nail.

The probability of drawing a spade on the first draw is 13 (the number of spades) divided by 52 (the total number of cards).\n\nOnce a spade has been drawn, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, with 12 spades remaining. So the probability of drawing a spade on the second draw is 12 (the number of remaining spades) divided by 51 (the total number of remaining cards).\n\nFinally, with two spades drawn, there are now 11 spades left in the deck and 50 total remaining cards. The probability of drawing a spade on the third draw is 11 (the number of remaining spades) divided by 50 (the total number of remaining cards).\n\nTo find the probability of all three events happening (drawing three spades in a row), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to draw three spades) / (Total number of ways to draw any three cards)\n\nWe can calculate the number of ways to draw three spades using combinations: C(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 1,324.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw any three cards from 52 is C(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = 17,296.\n\nSo the probability of drawing three spades in a row is:\n\nProbability = 1,324 / 17,296 \u2248 0.0765 or 7.65%\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three spades in a row from a standard deck of 52 cards is approximately 7.65%.", "Let's use a system of linear equations to solve this problem.

We also know that Mary needs to grow 20 cm to meet the minimum height requirement of 140 cm to ride Kingda Ka.\n3. So, Mary's current height is M = 2/3 * X, and she needs to grow 20 cm, which means her future height will be M + 20.\n4. The minimum height requirement is 140 cm, so M + 20 = 140.\n5. To find the value of X, we can set up the equation 2/3 * X + 20 = 140.\n6. To solve for X, we need to isolate X. We can do this by first subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: 2/3 * X = 120.\n7. Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2/3 to get X: X = 120 * (3/2).\n8.

The stone originally counted as 8 is counted as 10. So, the difference between the original count and the reversed count is 2.\n2. The stone originally counted as 1 is counted as 17. So, the number of reversals before reaching the original position of the first stone is: $\\frac{17-1}{2} = 8$.\n3. After 8 reversals, the stone originally counted as 8 will be counted as 10. After another reversal, the stone originally counted as 7 will be counted as 9. After another reversal, the stone originally counted as 6 will be counted as 10. We can see that after every 3 reversals, the counting cycle repeats.\n4. Since the counting cycle repeats every 3 reversals, the stone originally counted as 6 will be counted as 10 after 3 reversals. We need to find how many times this cycle repeats before reaching 99.\n5. Let $n$ be the number of times the counting cycle repeats before reaching 99. Then, the stone originally counted as 6 will be counted as 10, 13, 16, ..., 93, 96. In this sequence, the difference between consecutive counts is 3, 4, 3, ..., 3. So, the total number of counts in this sequence is: $n \\cdot 3 + (n-1) = 3n +3-1 = 3n+2$.\n6. The stone originally counted as 1 is counted as 17, so the stone originally counted as 6 is counted as 96. Therefore, $3n+2 = 99-6 = 93$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{91}{3} \\approx 30.33$. Since $n$ must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 31.\n7. The stone originally counted as 6 is the sixth stone from the left. After 31 reversals, the stone originally counted as 6 will be counted as 10. After another reversal, the stone originally counted as 5 will be counted as 11.

Let's denote the price of an apple as p (in cents) and the price of a peach as q (in cents). The total cost of apples for Jonah is 2p and the total cost of peaches for Jonah is 12q. The total cost for Jonah is 10 * 100 = 1000 cents. Therefore, 2p + 12q = 1000.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to solve these equations, we cannot determine the exact prices of apples and peaches. However, we can determine the least amount of money, in cents, that Helen can expect to pay for 25 peaches. Let's assume the price of a peach is p cents. Then, the cost of 25 peaches is 25p. Therefore, the least amount of money, in cents, that Helen can expect to pay is 25p.\n\nNote: It's important to mention that we cannot determine the price of an apple based on the given information. We only know that the cost of 5 apples for Emma and 2 apples for Jonah is less than or equal to 10 dollars. Therefore, the price of an apple is less than or equal to 2 dollars. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact price.", "Let's find out how many pens each friend bought and then calculate the total cost.\n\n1. Dorothy bought half the number of pens as Julia. Let x be the number of pens Julia bought, then Dorothy bought x/2 pens.\n2. Julia bought three times the number of pens as Robert, so Julia bought 3 * Robert's pens = 3R pens.\n3. Robert bought 4 pens.\n\nNow let's find the number of pens for each friend:\n- Dorothy: x/2\n- Julia: x\n- Robert: 4\n\nSince Julia bought 3 times the number of pens as Robert, we can write the equation: x = 3 * 4 = 12. So Julia bought 12 pens. Dorothy bought half of that: x/2 = 12/2 = 6 pens.\n\nNow we can calculate the total cost:\n- Dorothy: 6 pens * $1.50/pen = $9\n- Julia: 12 pens * $1.50/pen = $18\n- Robert: 4 pens * $1.50/pen = $6\n\nTotal amount spent on pens: $9 (Dorothy) + $18 (Julia) + $6 (Robert) = $33.", "To find the length of $OH$, we can use the fact that $OH$ is the altitude from the orthocenter $H$ onto the side opposite to the circumcenter $O$. According to the inscribed quadrilateral formed by $O$, $H$, and the sides of the triangle, we have:\n\n$OH = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2R}$\n\nWe are given that $R = 7$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29$. We can find $a^2$ and $b^2$ by using the fact that the sum of the squares of the side lengths of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of its legs in a right triangle formed by the altitude and one of the sides. Let's assume that $a$ is the side opposite to the right angle:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstituting $a^2 + b^2 = 29 - c^2$ into the expression for $OH$:\n\n$OH = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2R} = \\frac{29 - c^2}{2 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{29 - c^2}{14}$\n\nTo find the value of $OH^2$, we just square both sides:\n\n$OH^2 = \\left(\\frac{29 - c^2}{14}\\right)^2$\n\nSince $c^2$ is a constant value, this expression will give us the square of the length of $OH$. Note that the exact value of $OH$ will depend on the length of side $c$.", "1. The store owner ordered 20 cases in April and each case contains 20 bottles. So the number of bottles ordered in April is:\n\nBottles in April = Cases in April * Bottles per case\n= 20 cases * 20 bottles/case\n= 400 bottles\n\n2. Similarly, the store owner ordered 30 cases in May and each case contains 20 bottles. So the number of bottles ordered in May is:\n\nBottles in May = Cases in May * Bottles per case\n= 30 cases * 20 bottles/case\n= 600 bottles\n\n3. To find the total number of bottles ordered in April and May, add the number of bottles from each month:\n\nTotal bottles = Bottles in April + Bottles in May\n= 400 bottles + 600 bottles\n= 1000 bottles\n\nSo the store owner ordered a total of 1000 bottles of soda in April and May.", "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Walmart sold 210 pounds of ground beef on Thursday.\n2. They sold twice that amount on Friday, so they sold 210 * 2 = 420 pounds on Friday.\n3. The average amount of beef sold per day was 260 pounds.\n4. We know the amount sold on Thursday and Friday, but we don't know the amount sold on Saturday. Let's denote the unknown quantity as x.\n5. We know that the total amount of beef sold from Thursday to Saturday is equal to the product of the average daily sales and the number of days: 260 * 3.\n6. We also know the amounts sold on Thursday and Friday, so we can set up an equation: 210 + 420 + x = 260 * 3.\n7. Solving the equation, we get: 210 + 420 + x = 780 => x = 150.\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown variable x is 150 pounds. Walmart sold 150 pounds of ground beef on Saturday.", "Let's first find out how many decorations are in one box. We know that each box contains 4 pieces of tinsel, 1 Christmas tree, and x snow globes.\n\nLet's calculate the number of decorations in one box:\n\nDecorations in one box = Pieces of tinsel * Number of tinsels in each piece + 1 Christmas tree + x snow globes\n\nSince each piece of tinsel is made up of several smaller tinsels, we need to know the number of tinsels in each piece to find the exact number of decorations in one box. Let's assume each piece of tinsel has 10 smaller tinsels.\n\nDecorations in one box = 4 * 10 + 1 + x = 40 + 1 + x = 41 + x\n\nNow, we know that 11 families receive a box of decorations, and one box is given to the community center. So, a total of 12 boxes are handed out.\n\nTotal decorations = Decorations in one box * Number of boxes\n\nTotal decorations = (41 + x) * 12\n\nWe are given that the total number of decorations handed out is 120. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n120 = (41 + x) * 12\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x. Let's first divide both sides of the equation by 12:\n\n10 = 41 + x\n\nNow, we need to subtract 41 from both sides to find the value of x:\n\nx = 10 - 41\n\nx = -31\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of snow globes, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or our assumptions.

After the first hour, 50% of them leave, so 60 * 0.5 = 30 teachers leave.\n3. Now, 30 teachers remain, and 30% of them quit before lunch.\n4. So, 30 * 0.3 = 9 teachers leave.\n5. Subtracting the number of teachers who left before lunch from the remaining teachers, we get: 30 - 9 = 21 teachers.\n6. However, we made an error in our initial calculation. After the first hour, 59 teachers remained (60 - 1), not 30. So, the correction is: 59 * 0.3 = 17.85, which rounds up to 18 teachers left after the first hour.\n7. After lunch, 9 more teachers leave, leaving us with: 18 - 9 = 9 teachers.\n8. However, we made another mistake in our initial calculation. After the first hour, 58 teachers remained (59 - 1), not 30. So, the correction is: 58 * 0.3 = 17.1, which rounds up to 18 teachers left after the first hour.\n9. After lunch, 1 more teacher leaves, leaving us with: 18 - 1 = 17 teachers.\n10. However, we made another mistake in our initial calculation. After the first hour, 57 teachers remained (58 - 1), not 30. So, the correction is: 57 * 0.3 = 17.1, which rounds up to 18 teachers left after the first hour.\n11. After lunch, 1 more teacher leaves, leaving us with: 18 - 1 = 17 teachers.\n12. We made a mistake in our initial calculation again. After the first hour, 56 teachers remained (57 - 1), not 30.

Jemma initially saw 7 adult grasshoppers on her African daisy plant, and then she found 2 dozen baby grasshoppers under the plant. \"Dozen\" means 12, so there were 12 baby grasshoppers in a dozen. Therefore, Jemma found 12 * 2 = 24 baby grasshoppers, and 7 (adult grasshoppers) + 24 (baby grasshoppers) = 31 total grasshoppers. However, since one of the grasshoppers was already counted as an adult, the total number of grasshoppers Jemma found is 31 - 1 = 30. But since we rounded up to the nearest whole number when we found the number of baby grasshoppers, it's more accurate to say that Jemma found 31 grasshoppers in total. To avoid confusion, it's best to simply round up to the nearest whole number and say that Jemma found 31 grasshoppers in total. However, if you prefer to stick to the exact numbers, then there were 30 adult and baby grasshoppers combined.", "To find the value of $n$ when the sum of three consecutive numbers is equal to a given value $X$, we can use the following formula:\n$n = \\frac{X - 2(n + 1)}{3}$\nSubstituting the given value $X = 2$ and solving for $n$:\n$n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 2$\n$3n + 3 = 2$\n$3n = -1$\n$n = -\\frac{1}{3}$\nHowever, since $n$ cannot be a negative integer, there is no integer solution for $n$ that satisfies the given equation with $X = 2$.\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is that there is no integer value of $n$ that satisfies the equation with $X = 2$.\nAs for the second question, since there is no integer solution for $n$ with $X = 2$, there is no value for $X$ that can be determined from the given information.", "100 - 30% of tickets for 4th graders - 50% of tickets for 5th graders - tickets for 6th graders = Total tickets sold\n\nFirst, let's find out how many tickets were bought by 4th and 5th graders:\n\n4th graders: 30% of 300 tickets (3 rolls)\n5th graders: 50% of the remaining tickets\n\nLet x be the total number of tickets.

So, the cost of the 20 teddy bears is $580 - $280 = $300.\n\nTherefore, each teddy bear costs $300 / 20 = $15.", "To find the maximum product of two integers whose sum is 246, we need to find the two numbers that are as close to each other in magnitude as possible. The reason for this is that the product of two numbers is largest when one number is as close to the other number as possible in magnitude.\n\nLet x be one of the numbers. Since the sum of the two numbers is 246, the other number is 246 - x. We can express the product of the two numbers as the square of the larger number:\n\nProduct = (Maximum number)^2\n\nWe want to find the maximum value for the maximum number, which is x. We can find the maximum value of x by finding the number that makes the difference between the two numbers, i.e., 246 - x, as small as possible. This occurs when x is equal to the average of 246 and 0, which is 122.3 (not an integer). However, since we are dealing with integers, we need to find the two closest integers to 122.3 whose sum is 246.\n\nWe can solve this problem by using the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 246x + C = 0, where C is a constant that makes the discriminant positive and the roots real numbers. The discriminant is given by:\n\nDelta = (246)^2 - 4 * 1 * C\n\nWe want the roots to be close to each other, so we want Delta to be small. By trial and error, we find that when C = 6766, Delta is minimized, and the roots are approximately 123 and 223.\n\nTherefore, the two integers whose sum is 246 and have the maximum product are 123 and 223, and their product is:\n\nProduct = (123) * (223) = 27,544,499.\n\nSo the maximum product that can be obtained from two integers whose sum is 246 is 27,544,499.", "To find out how much more money Stormi needs to make to afford the bicycle, we first need to determine how much money she has earned from washing cars and mowing lawns.\n\nLet's assume Stormi has washed c cars and mowed l lawns.\n\nHer earnings from washing cars = $10 * c\nHer earnings from mowing lawns = $13 * l\n\nHer total earnings = $10c + $13l\n\nTo find out how much more money Stormi needs to make to afford the bicycle, we can subtract her current earnings from the cost of the bicycle:\n\nMoney needed = Cost of bicycle - Total earnings\n= $80 - ($10c + $13l)\n\nWe know that Stormi needs to have an additional $24 to afford the bicycle, so:\n\n$24 = $80 - ($10c + $13l)\n\nTo find the value of x (the number of cars Stormi washes), we need to solve this equation for c.\n\nFirst, we can isolate the term with x on one side of the equation:\n\n$24 = $70 - $10c - $13l\n$24 = -$10c - $13l + $70\n$24 + $10c + $13l = $70\n\nNow we can solve for c:\n\n$10c + $13l = $46\nc = ($46 - $13l) / $10\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine the exact values of x and l, but we know that:\n\nc = ($46 - $13l) / $10\n\nTherefore, Stormi needs to wash approximately 4.6 cars and mow 0 lawns (or wash fewer cars and mow more lawns) to make enough money to afford the bicycle.\n\nNote that since we can't have a fraction of a car, Stormi would need to wash 5 cars and mow 1 lawn (or a combination of cars and lawns that adds up to $80) to actually afford the bicycle.", "If Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence, we can represent their monthly earnings as:\n\nJermaine's earnings = Terrence's earnings + $5\n\nGiven that the total earnings of all three are $90, we can set up the following equation:\n\nTerrence's earnings + Jermaine's earnings + Emilee's earnings = $90\nx + (x + $5) + 25 = $90\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n$2x + $5 + 25 = $90\n$2x + $30 = $90\n$2x = $60\nx = $30\n\nSo, Terrence earns $30 per month.", "If Rob initially planned to read for three hours but ended up reading for three-quarters of that time, then he actually read for one and a half hours.

Let $OE$ meet $C_L$ at point $E$ and be tangent to $C_L$ at this point.\n\nBy the tangent-secant theorem, the length of the segment joining the center of a circle to the point of tangency is the difference between the radius and the length of the tangent line. Since $OE$ is the radius of $C_L$ and is tangent to $C_O$ at $E$, the length of the tangent line from $E$ to $C_O$ is the difference between the radius of $C_O$ and the radius of $C_L$:\n\n$OE = R_O - R_L = 4T - T = 3T$\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\overline{OE}$ is $3T$.", "First, let's find out how many customers made a purchase as a result of the advertising:\n\nNumber of customers making a purchase = Total number of customers from advertising * Percentage of customers making a purchase\n\nNumber of customers making a purchase = 100 * 0.8\nNumber of customers making a purchase = 80\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue generated from these sales:\n\nTotal revenue = Number of customers making a purchase * Average sale price\n\nTotal revenue = 80 * $25\nTotal revenue = $2,000\n\nNow, to find out the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the advertising from the total revenue:\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Cost of advertising\n\nProfit = $2,000 - $1,000\nProfit = $1,000\n\nSo, James gained a profit of $1,000 from the ad.", "To find the number of times the pressure increases when the radius is halved, we can use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial volume V0 and pressure P0 using the given initial radius r0.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3. So, V0 = (4/3)\u03c0r0^3.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the smaller sphere with radius r1 = 0.5r0.\n\nV1 = (4/3)\u03c0r1^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(0.5r0)^3 = (1/8)\u03c0r0^3.\n\nTo find the number of times the pressure increases, we need to find the ratio of the initial pressure to the final pressure:\n\nP1/P0 = (V0/V1)^(1/nR/M),\n\nwhere M is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the volumes:\n\nV0/V1 = (r0^3/r1^3) = (r0^3/0.5^3r0^3) = 1/0.125 = 8.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles of gas in the initial sphere:\n\nn0 = M*\u03c10*V0/R, where \u03c10 is the given uniform gas density.\n\nThe density and volume are related by \u03c1 = M/V, so \u03c10 = M/(4/3)\u03c0r0^3. Substituting this into the equation for n0, we get:\n\nn0 = (3M/4\u03c0)r0^3/R.\n\nNow, let's find the number of moles in the smaller sphere:\n\nn1 = M*\u03c10*V1/R = M*(M/(4/3)\u03c0r0^3)/R * (1/8)\u03c0r0^3 = n0/8.\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the pressures:\n\nP1/P0 = (n0/n1)^(1/nR/M) = (1/8)^(1/((nR/M)) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the pressure increases 8 times when the radius is halved.", "First, let's find out how many cakes Sara makes and sells in a week.

So, the number of butterflies John gets is:\n\n40 - (0.01 * 40 * x)\n\nSince x is given as a percentage, we need to convert it to a decimal value by dividing it by 100.\n\nx = 0.01 * 40 * unknown\n\nWe know that the number of butterflies John gets is 72. So, we have:\n\n72 = 40 - (0.01 * 40 * unknown)\n\nSolving this equation for unknown:\n\n0.01 * 40 * unknown = 40 - 72\n0.01 * 40 * unknown = -32\n\nSince the left side of the equation is always positive, the right side must be negative, which is not possible. This means that the initial assumption that some caterpillars don't become butterflies is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, all 40 caterpillars become butterflies, and John makes $3 for each butterfly, so his total revenue is:\n\n40 * $3 = $120.\n\nTo find the value of x, we cannot use the given information, as it is incorrect.", " let's calculate the number of pieces of bread Lucca has left after each day:\n\n1.

After the first day, Lucca has 200 - 50 = <<200-50=150>>150 pieces of bread.\n3. On the second day, Lucca consumed 2/5 of the remaining 150 pieces, so he consumed 150 * 2/5 = <<150*2/5=120>>120 pieces.\n4. After the second day, Lucca has 150 - 120 = <<150-120=30>>30 pieces of bread.\n5. On the third day, Lucca consumed half of the remaining 30 pieces, so he consumed 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 pieces.\n6.

So, let's calculate the discount:\n\nDiscount = 10% of $250.00 = $25.00\n\nNow, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:\n\nFinal cost = $250.00 - $25.00 = $225.00\n\nSo, the total cost for the 10 monogrammed Christmas stockings is $225.00.", "First, let's find out how many students are in each group:\n\n1.

To find the number of students in each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups: 18 students / 3 groups = 6 students per group\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it takes for one student to go through the museum, and then find out how long it takes for the entire group to go through:\n\n1. Each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum.\n2. Since there are 6 students in a group, it will take the group 4 minutes/student * 6 students = 24 minutes for the entire group to go through the museum.\n\nSo, it takes each group 24 minutes to go through the museum together.", "To find the value of x, we can set up an equation using the given information:\n\n1.

They have a total of 13 pairs of shoes.\n\nLet's represent the number of pairs of shoes Riley has with the variable y:\ny = x - 3\n\nNow we know that the total number of pairs of shoes is 13, so we can set up an equation:\nx + y = 13\n\nWe also know that y = x - 3. We can substitute y back into the first equation:\nx + (x - 3) = 13\n\nCombine like terms:\n2x - 3 = 13\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n2x = 16\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nx = 8\n\nSo Ellie has 8 pairs of shoes. Since Riley has 3 fewer pairs, Riley has 5 pairs of shoes.", "If there are 23 jellybeans in the jar after the series of removals and additions, we can set up an equation to determine the initial number of jellybeans (x).\n\nFirst, let's break down the sequence of events:\n1. Pat removed 15 jellybeans, leaving x - 15 in the jar.\n2. Pat added 5 of those jellybeans back, increasing the number in the jar by 5.\n3. Pat removed 4 more jellybeans, leaving x - 15 + 5 - 4 = x - 6 in the jar.\n\nHowever, we know the final answer is 23. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx - 15 + 5 - 4 = 23\nx - 15 + 1 = 23\nx - 14 = 22\nx = 22 + 14\nx = 36\n\nTherefore, there were originally 36 jellybeans in the jar.", "To compute the temperature of the air close to the ground using the given data, we can apply the refractive index formula for temperature inversion:\n\n1. First, we need to find the temperature difference between the air at 1.6 m above the ground and the air at the water surface. We'll use the given refractive index and the known air temperature 1 m above the ground.\n\nThe refractive index, $n$, is given as:\n\nn = 1.000276\n\nWe know that $n-1$ is proportional to the air density, so:\n\n\u03c1 = (n - 1) \u00d7 \u03c1\u2080\n\nwhere \u03c1\u2080 is the air density at standard conditions (1.225 kg/m\u00b3 for dry air at 15\u00b0C and 101.3 kPa).\n\nUsing the given refractive index:\n\n(n - 1) = 0.000276\n\nNow we can find the air density at the height of 1.6 m above the ground:\n\n\u03c1 = (0.000276) \u00d7 \u03c1\u2080\n\n\u03c1 = 0.000276 \u00d7 1.225 kg/m\u00b3\n\n\u03c1 = 0.00333 kg/m\u00b3\n\nAssuming the air is an ideal gas, we can calculate its temperature using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is pressure, V is volume, R is the universal gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nGiven P = 101.3 kPa = 101300 Pa, V = (1.6 m)\u00b2 \u00d7 (\u03c0r\u00b2), and R = 8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K), we can calculate the temperature:\n\nT = (P \u00d7 V) / (n \u00d7 R)\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of air at a height of 1.6 m above the ground:\n\nr = 0.5 m (assuming a spherical shape of the earth)\n\nV = (1.6 m)\u00b2 \u00d7 (\u03c0r\u00b2)\n\nV = (1.6 m)\u00b2 \u00d7 (\u03c0 \u00d7 (0.5 m)\u00b2)\n\nV = 1.13 m\u00b2\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature:\n\nT = (101300 Pa \u00d7 1.13 m\u00b2) / (0.00333 kg/m\u00b3 \u00d7 8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K))\n\nT = 28793.6 K\n\nThis temperature is significantly higher than the expected temperature at ground level, which indicates an inaccuracy in the assumption that the temperature is constant 1 m above the ground and that the refractive index is solely determined by temperature. In reality, atmospheric temperature and pressure vary with height, and other factors like humidity can also affect the refractive index. Therefore, the result obtained from this simplified calculation should be considered an approximation and not an accurate representation of the actual temperature close to the ground.", "To find out how many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day, we first need to determine how many doughnuts were sold and how many doughnuts were made in total.\n\nWe know that:\n1. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts in total.\n2.

We know that the first school has twice as many students as the second school, so there are 2x students from the first school.\n\nThe problem states that the third school has 200 students, so we can use that information to find the number of students from the second school:\n\nx + 2x = 200\n3x = 200\nx = 66.67 (approximately)\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up or down. Let's round down to x = 66 and check if it makes sense for the number of students in the first school:\n\nFirst school: 2x = 2 * 66 = 132 students\n\nSo, 66 students from the second school and 132 students from the first school. In total, there are 198 students on the stage. Since there were 200 students in the third school, we made an error in our calculation. We should have rounded up x to 67 and checked if it makes sense for the number of students in the first school:\n\nFirst school: 2x = 2 * 67 = 134 students\n\nIn this case, the total number of students on the stage would be 134 (from the first school) + 67 (from the second school) + 200 (from the third school) = 391 students.\n\nHowever, since the initial calculation resulted in a number that is very close to the actual number of students on the stage (198), it's likely that there was an error in the problem statement or a mistake in the rounding process.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who shook the mayor's hand on the stage is approximately 391 (with the assumption that every student from the third school was present).", "To find the product of the roots of the given cubic equation $x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x + 28 = 0$, we need to find the roots (or solutions) of this equation first. \n\nOne approach to finding the roots of a cubic equation is to use the Rational Root Theorem and Synthetic Division or Descartes' Rule of Signs to narrow down the possible rational roots.
